If you are a first time user of Microsoft XML Diff and Patch, 
read the documentation. The conceptual material in the 
documentation is written to provide quick start to new users.

The tool is provided as is.

1.1 Guidelines
-------------------------------

* Changing diffgrams created by the tool is not recommended. 
The tool might not be able to patch the original file if 
the diffgram is modified.

* Relying on diffgrams generated by the tool directly (e.g. 
reading them in a program and doing operations based on the
information in the diffgrams) is not recommended. Microsoft
reserves the right to change the diffgram format without 
notice.
